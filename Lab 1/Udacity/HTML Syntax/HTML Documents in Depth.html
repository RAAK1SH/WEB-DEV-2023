<!-- Question 1
Using the W3C HTML Validator, what happens when you enter the following HTML into the "validate by input" text box:    

<h1>This is a title</h1>

Answer:The validator found errors or warnings in the HTML.
The validator assumed the document was something other than HTML5
Question 2
Now, modify the HTML you entered previously so it follows the HTML template. Make sure to set doctype for HTML5!
What is the message displayed once the validator successfully validates your code?

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>This is a title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a h1</h1>
    </body>
</html>

Answer:Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show. -->
